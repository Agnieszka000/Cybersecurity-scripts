Collection of my scripts for automating cybersecurity tasks.


Index:

- ADVANCED PORT SCANNER (advanced_port_scanner.py)
  Standalone program. Asks for a host (IP or address) and port(s) to scan.
  
- BANNER GRABBER (banner_grabber.py)
  Program that grabs a banner for a given IP/URL and port.

- CERT SCRAPER (cert_scraper.py)
  Program that finds subdomains for a given domain on the website cert.sh and saves them to an Excel file.
  
- VULNERABILITY SCANNER (vulnerability_scanner.py)
  Program that checks if any of the 1000 top ports is vulnerable.
  
-  VIRUSTOTAL IP SCANNER (VirusTotal_IP_scanner.py)

  To perform a scan your API key is needed.
